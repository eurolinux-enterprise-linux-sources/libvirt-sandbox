=head1 NAME

virt-sandbox-service upgrade - upgrade an existing Secure container

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Upgrade a Security container

  virt-sandbox-service [-c URI] upgrade NAME

=head1 DESCRIPTION

virt-sandbox-service is used to manage secure sandboxed system services.
These applications will be launched via libvirt and run within a virtualization
technology such as LinuX Containers (LXC), or optionally QEMU/KVM. The
container / virtual machines will be secured by SELinux and resource
separated using cgroups.

The upgrade command will update the config files for NAME to be compatible
with the currently installed software version. NB this works in an upgrade
direction only, it is not possible to install older versions of the software
and use this command to downgrade the configs.

/var/lib/libvirt/filesystems, by default.  You can manage the
content in these directories outside of the container and
processes within the container will see the content.
