=head1 DESCRIPTION

virt-sandbox-service is used to provision secure sandboxed system services.
These applications will be launched via libvirt and run within a virtualization
technology such as LinuX Containers (LXC), or optionally QEMU/KVM. The
container / virtual machines will be secured by SELinux and resource
separated using cgroups.

By default, it will use the libvirt LXC driver, with the C<lxc:///> URI.
This is different from libvirt's normal behaviour, which is to probe
for the best URI to use. Thus if using C<virsh> to get a list of containers,
one must specify an explicit URI for it, C<virsh -c lxc:///>. Alternatively
the C<LIBVIRT_DEFAULT_URI> environment variable can be set, or the config
file C</etc/libvirt/libvirt.conf> can have a default URI set.

=head1 FILES

Container content will be stored in subdirectories of
/var/lib/libvirt/filesystems, by default.  You can manage the
content in these directories outside of the container and
processes within the container will see the content.
