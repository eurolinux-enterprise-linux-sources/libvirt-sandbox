=head1 DESCRIPTION

virt-sandbox-service is used to manage secure sandboxed system services.
These applications will be launched via libvirt and run within a virtualization
technology such as LinuX Containers (LXC), or optionally QEMU/KVM. The
container / virtual machines will be secured by SELinux and resource
separated using cgroups.

The execute subcommand is used to execute commands within an already running container.
