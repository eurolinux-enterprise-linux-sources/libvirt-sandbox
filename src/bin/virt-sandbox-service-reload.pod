virt-sandbox-service reload - Reload a security container

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  virt-sandbox-service [-c URI] reload [-h] -u UNIT_FILE NAME

=head1 DESCRIPTION

virt-sandbox-service is used to manage secure sandboxed system services.
These applications will be launched via libvirt and run within a virtualization
technology such as LinuX Containers (LXC), or optionally QEMU/KVM. The
container / virtual machines will be secured by SELinux and resource
separated using cgroups.

The reload command will reload a sandbox container.  This is used when software is updated outside of a container and processes within the container need to reload or restart.  For example, if you update your httpd software, and you had a running container that was using the httpd service, systemd would send the reload to the container.
